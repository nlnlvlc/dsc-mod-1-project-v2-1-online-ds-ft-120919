## Q1: Is there any pattern between the profitability of a film and the date/year/month it is released?

### Findings
After examining the top 10% of the most profitable films of all time, I found that a high concentration of the most profitable films are released during May, June, July, November, and December. Though December has one of the highest concetrations of most profitable films, the following month, January, has the lowest concentrations. We also see a gradual increase in average revenue earnings, when looking at mean values, the top 5%, and overall earnings over years and decades, even though the minimum values for the highest profit films have not significantly changed.

### Recommendations

If looking for a period of time for a film,premier it in June
If going for a Winter release, releases during the end of winter might perform better than mid-to-late winter

## Q2: Is there any pattern between the profitability and the number of international release?

### Findings

After looking into the relationship between the profitability and the number of regions where a single film is released, I found that there is no apparent relationships between the two.

### Next Steps

* Plan on exploring further correlations between profitability and directors, studios, and international releases
* If the number of regions where a title is theatrically released isn't a factor in profitability, plan on identifying the most profitable international regions and compare performance to domestic profit

### Next Steps

* Plan on exploring further correlations between profitability and directors, studios, and international releases
* If the number of regions where a title is theatrically released isn't a factor in profitability, plan on identifying the most profitable international regions and compare performance to domestic profit
